A) iterate tables and combine

SELECT * FROM tbl_list AS t
for i in t
  SELECT * FROM i
end

SELECT * FROM tbl_list as t
for [i | argv_tables > 0] in t
  SELECT * FROM i.field_names as f
  fields = [v | argv_fields > 0]
    SELECT fields FROM t
    [ | argv_crtieria > 0 ]
    WHERE fields[...] = argv_criteria

Dependencies:
D-1) sqlite fetch list of tables.
D-2) sqlite fetch list of field names per table.

Problems:
P-1) supplied field names that don't exist in
one table but do in another.
A-1) always query for list of tables/ fields and
check against the list for existence to avoid
sqlite returning errors.
P1-1) poor scalability because checking
for all tables -> for all fields.
S1-1) there are existence checks that avoid this problem.
the only overhead is querying every table (less if specified)
for its name and fields. the remaining logic is the same
as a regualr query.
